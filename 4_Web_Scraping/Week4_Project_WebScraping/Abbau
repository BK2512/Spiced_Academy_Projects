(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
(It's Vade on the keys)

Niggas dyin', fallin' stars through the night
And I been thinking 'bout you every night
If you happy, I know that I should be alright
'Cause this tragic and I can't seem for to decide

And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? I
Should I try or just, I can't lie, I just
I be wanting for to cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocka
Every time I catch my feelings, lock 'em in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada

Don't know who I want, you the one I want, oh
Never said I don't, that's that money talk, oh
Drunker than a skunk, it go down in the room
Choppas in the trunk, baby, this that slime tone
But I need yo love like right now, baby, ooh
I'm not on no drugs, not right now, it's the truth
I apologize for you looking like a fool
I can't hold you right now so I been holdin' on my tool
I don't want my ex, I don't want no bitch I had
I just want a chance, hopefully I make you glad
If you turn me down, tell the truth, I just might spazz
If who around laugh, I just probably bust they ass

And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? I
Should I try or just, I can't lie, I just
I be wanting for to cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocka
Every time I catch my feelings, lock 'em in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada (Nevada)
